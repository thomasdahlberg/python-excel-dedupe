# Python Excel Dedupe

This program is the start of what may become a suite of simple python programs to help everyday users of spreadsheets automate some of their tasks.

I'm starting with a dedupe program because often I know I need to dedupe a data set before even opening the file and often it's the only work I have to do with that file.

Booting up Excel, as powerful as it is, often wastes a fair amount of time. In the pursuit of efficiency, here goes!

## Prerequisites

This is a CLI program meant to be called in a Python runtime environment in the terminal. It depends on the functionality of openpyxl, so installing that is a prerequesite.

## Getting Started

-Download the program folder from github and place in a working directory such as 'Desktop.'
-Add the Excel document that you want to manipulate to the 'Workdocs' folder.
-Open terminal.

## Calling the Program

In the terminal call 'dedupe.py' in python like so:

>$python3 dedupe.py 1st_arg 2nd_arg
